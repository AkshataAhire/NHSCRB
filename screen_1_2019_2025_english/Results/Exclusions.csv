J517,2019,The health economics of ankle and foot sprains and fractures: A systematic review of English-language published papers. Part 2: The direct and indirect costs of injury,"Background: Ankle and foot sprains and fractures are prevalent injuries, which may result in substantial physical and economic consequences for the patient and place a financial burden on the health care system. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are to examine the direct and indirect costs of treating ankle and foot injuries (sprains, dislocations, fractures), as well as to provide an overview of the outcomes of full economic analyses of different treatment strategies. Method(s): A systematic review was carried out among seven databases to identify English language publications on the health economics of ankle and foot injury treatment published between 1980 and 2014. The direct and indirect costs were abstracted by two independent reviewers. All costs were adjusted for inflation and reported in 2016 US dollars (USD). Result(s): Among 2047 identified studies, 32 were selected for analysis. The direct costs of ankle sprain management ranged from $292 to $2268 per patient (2016 USD), depending on the injury severity and treatment strategy. The direct costs of managing ankle fractures were higher ($1908-$19,555). Foot fracture treatment had similar direct costs ranging from $998 to $21,801. The economic evaluations were conducted from the societal or payer's perspectives. Conclusion(s): The costs of treating ankle and foot sprains and fractures varied among the studies, mostly due to differences in injury type and study characteristics, which impacted the ability of directly comparing the financial burden of treatment. Nonetheless, the review showed that the costs experienced by the patient and the health care system increased with injury complexity. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE
J582,2019,Recontacting patients in clinical genetics services: recommendations of the European Society of Human Genetics,"Technological advances have increased the availability of genomic data in research and the clinic. If, over time, interpretation of the significance of the data changes, or new information becomes available, the question arises as to whether recontacting the patient and/or family is indicated. The Public and Professional Policy Committee of the European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG), together with research groups from the UK and the Netherlands, developed recommendations on recontacting which, after public consultation, have been endorsed by ESHG Board. In clinical genetics, recontacting for updating patients with new, clinically significant information related to their diagnosis or previous genetic testing may be justifiable and, where possible, desirable. Consensus about the type of information that should trigger recontacting converges around its clinical and personal utility. The organization of recontacting procedures and policies in current health care systems is challenging. It should be sustainable, commensurate with previously obtained consent, and a shared responsibility between healthcare providers, laboratories, patients, and other stakeholders. Optimal use of the limited clinical resources currently available is needed. Allocation of dedicated resources for recontacting should be considered. Finally, there is a need for more evidence, including economic and utility of information for people, to inform which strategies provide the most cost-effective use of healthcare resources for recontacting.

J584,2019,Physiotherapy triage service for cancer patients - a service evaluation,"Purpose: Individuals with cancer experience a plethora of symptoms from diagnosis, through treatment and beyond into survivorship. Allied Health Professionals are uniquely placed to impact upon these symptoms by engaging individuals in rehabilitation. Scoping of rehabilitation services amongst individuals with cancer undergoing haematological and oncological treatment highlighted various issues with fatigue, loss of function, pain and breathlessness. A pilot programme was implemented to address these unmet needs. Method(s): In an acute teaching trust in the South West of England, individuals with cancer were highlighted by health care professionals and referred into the Therapy Treatment Support Service (TTSS). Included individuals had a cancer diagnosis and were adults aged 16 years and over, exclusion criteria specified those under 16 years of age and those without a cancer diagnosis. Telephone triage carried out by a physiotherapist provided appropriate interventions including fatigue management, musculoskeletal treatment, exercise programmes and breathlessness advice for individuals. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) was used as a quality of life outcome measure on initial and final contact. Result(s): Between March 2017 and March 2018 220 individuals were referred to TTSS with the following numbers specifying the primary reason for referral, 81 for fatigue, 71 for musculoskeletal issues, 42 for physical activity issues, 20 for mobility issues and 6 for breathlessness. In total 44 of 53 completed datasets demonstrated positive outcomes in terms of quality of life using the FACT-G. Of 23 completed datasets with fatigue as the primary reason for referral, 21 demonstrated an improvement. Conclusion(s): Fatigue is the primary reason for referral to TTSS and its interventions have shown a positive impact upon quality of life. A more detailed enquiry is required to investigate this service model. Implications: There is discrepancy in service provision for fatigue management amongst the population of those living with and beyond cancer. A cost-effective intervention that can provide equitable access is required to meet the aims stated in the Recovery Package. A standardised intervention delivered via a telephone clinic could reach a significant population of those living with and beyond cancer improving cancer-related fatigue symptoms.
