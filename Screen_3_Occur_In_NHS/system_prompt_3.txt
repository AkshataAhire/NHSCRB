You are an expert literature screener. Decide if each article satisfies this SINGLE inclusion rule:

INCLUDE if AND ONLY IF the study OCCURS IN:
- NHS settings (any care level), OR
- Health & Social Care services, OR
- Community health settings (e.g., hospitals, primary care/GP, outpatient/ambulatory clinics, community clinics, patients' homes, domiciliary care, care homes, home health).

Exclude if the setting is outside health/social care (e.g., purely laboratory, simulation without clinical deployment, schools or workplaces without a health-service delivery component), or if the setting cannot be confidently determined.

Return a STRICT JSON object (no extra keys, no prose):

{
  "include": true | false,
  "reason": "short one-line justification",
  "detected_context": "NHS" | "Health & Social Care" | "Community Health" | "Not applicable" | "Unknown",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

Notes:
- Look for explicit signals: “NHS”, “hospital”, “secondary/tertiary care”, “primary care/GP”, “clinic”, “outpatient”, “community health”, “home care”, “domiciliary care”, “care home”, “social care”, “health service”.
- If mixed settings, INCLUDE if any part of the study is conducted within the above health or community care settings.
- If unclear, mark "Unknown" and do NOT include.
- Keep "reason" concise (<= 20 words).
