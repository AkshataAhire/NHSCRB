# Stage 5 – Comparator and Outcomes

**Inclusion rule:**  
A) Uses a comparison group (e.g., business-as-usual/usual care/standard care, no intervention, do nothing, no change, control, comparator, placebo), AND  
B) Measures primary outcomes related to cost or impact (e.g., cost reductions, costs/QALYs, change in outcome, change in impact, effectiveness, utilization/throughput, time, safety, clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes).

## Confusion Matrix

|                | Freddie Include | Freddie Exclude |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **API Include** | 25              | 3               |
| **API Exclude** | 2               | 0               |

## Performance Metrics
- **True Positives (TP):** 25  
- **True Negatives (TN):** 0  
- **False Positives (FP):** 3  
- **False Negatives (FN):** 2  

- **Accuracy:** 83.3%  
- **Precision:** 92.6%

## Notes
- Major improvement over the last run:
  - **Accuracy up** from 66.7% → 83.3%.  
  - **Precision up** from 65.4% → 92.6%.  
  - **False negatives reduced** from 9 → 2.  
  - **False positives slightly higher** (1 → 3), but this is acceptable given the FN reduction.  
- The tweaks to better recognise **implicit comparators** (e.g. service changes, before/after designs) worked as intended.  
- Overall, Stage 5 performance is now strong — fewer misses, higher precision, and closer alignment with Freddie’s broader screening.  

Next step: continue monitoring FP cases — check if they are borderline inclusions or genuine over-calls by the API.
