# Stage 5 – Comparator and outcomes

A) Uses a comparison group (e.g., business-as-usual/usual care/standard care, no intervention, do nothing, no change, control, comparator, placebo), AND
B) Measures primary outcomes related to cost or impact (e.g., cost reductions, costs/QALYs, change in outcome, change in impact, effectiveness, utilization/throughput, time, safety, clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes).

## Confusion Matrix

|                | Freddie Include | Freddie Exclude |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **API Include** | 17              | 1               |
| **API Exclude** | 9               | 3               |

## Performance Metrics
- **True Positives (TP):** 17  
- **True Negatives (TN):** 3  
- **False Positives (FP):** 1  
- **False Negatives (FN):** 9  

- **Accuracy:** 66.7%  
- **Precision:** 65.4%

## Notes
- Validation now reflects Freddie’s broader screening rule (cost + impact outcomes).
- Compared with the initial narrower run (Accuracy 60%, Precision 75%, 3 FN, 8 FP):
- False positives have dropped sharply (8 → 1).
- False negatives increased (3 → 9) → API still misses studies with implicit comparators (before/after, service changes without explicit “vs standard care” wording).
- Accuracy has improved modestly, but precision has fallen slightly.

Next step: decide whether to adjust API to better handle implicit comparators, or leave these for Stage 8 manual review.
